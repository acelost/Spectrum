# Spectrum

A fast UI hierarchy inspector for Android applications.

# Why do you need it

We all love to write code. 
I'm sure we know every class, every method, every variable that we have ever created or edited. 
Man's code is his castle. 
But one day we have to go to another castle. 
And what will we see there? 
At first glance, this is all the same familiar code. 
All the same Activities, Fragments and what else is there in the Android. 
But the application is large and it will take a lot of time to study its structure.

And here Spectrum comes to the rescue. 
This utility will monitor changes in the application and print actual Activity-Fragment-View connections tree to the logcat. 
Now, it will take much less time to find the class in which you need to correct TextView color from the bug report screenshot.
